# 📝 JavaScript Form Validation

This is a **simple form validation project** that checks a user's **username**, **email**, and **password** on submission.  
It makes sure:

✅ The **Username** is at least 3 letters long.  
✅ The **Email** contains **@** and **.**.  
✅ The **Password** is at least 8 letters long.

If everything is correct, it shows a green "Registration successful!" message.  
If something is invalid, it shows a red message with all the problems.

## 🔹Features

- Pure JavaScript (without any libraries).
- Validation performs on the **client side**, preventing submission if validation fails.
- Displays clear messages to help users know what they need to fix.
